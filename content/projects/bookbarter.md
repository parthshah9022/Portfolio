○ Created a SwiftUI application for managing and exchanging books locally, implementing features for book donation and exchange within nearby areas.

○ Managed the state of SwiftUI views using @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, and @EnvironmentObject property wrappers to trigger UI updates based on changes in the application state.

○ Leveraged SwiftUI's two-way data binding capabilities to establish dynamic relationships between model data
and UI elements, ensuring real-time updates.
